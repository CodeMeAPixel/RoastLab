# RoastLab: Because Your Website Needs a Reality Check

Welcome to RoastLab, the app that's here to lovingly tear your website apart and put it back together... maybe. We're like that brutally honest friend you never knew you needed, but for your web presence.

## What's This Madness?

RoastLab is a Next.js application that analyzes websites and provides a sarcastic, ironic, and somewhat humorous roast of things you could improve regarding SEO and Google's Core Web Vitals. Because let's face it, your website probably needs it.

## Features

- SEO analysis (because meta tags are still a thing, apparently)
- Core Web Vitals check (we'll tell you if your site is as slow as a sloth on sedatives)
- Sarcastic commentary (our AI has a PhD in Sass)
- Responsive design (unlike your website, probably)

## Technologies

This project uses a plethora of dependencies because why use one when you can use twenty? Here are some highlights:

- Next.js (for that sweet, sweet server-side rendering)
- React (because who doesn't love a good component hierarchy?)
- Tailwind CSS (for when you're too lazy to write your own CSS)
- Framer Motion (to add some pizzazz to your pain)
- Zod (because TypeScript wasn't strict enough)
- React Query (for fetching data and caching your shame)
- Vercel AI SDK - The AI Toolkit for TypeScript and JavaScript

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add more sass to our roasts? Feel free to contribute! Just remember, we roast code contributions as mercilessly as we roast websites.

Now go forth and roast some websites! Remember, a good roast is like a good website: it should be quick, impactful, and leave people wanting more... unlike most of the sites you'll be analyzing.
